Create System DSN
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Create System DSN in Windows"
Alternatives:
  1a. "Create System DSN in Linux"
  
Create System DSN in Windows
Note: 
  -Guidance for using installed MySQL ODBC driver @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-configuration-dsn-windows-5-2.html
  -A User DSN can only be seen by you and is only accessible on this computer
  -A System DSN can be use by all users of the computer and is only accessible on the computer
  -Map of MySQL Workbench connection attributes to DSN attributes
    -"Connection Name" to "Data Source Name"
    -"Hostname" to "TCP/IP Server"
    -"Port" to "Port"
    -"Username" to "User"
    -"Password" to "Password"
    -"Default Schema" to "Database"
  -why use Ansi or unicode driver?
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Open "ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)" (search for "ODBC Data Source" to find it)
  2. Go to "Drivers" tab
  3. Confirm MySQL ODBC Ansi and Unicode drivers are there
  4. Go to "System DNS" tab 
  5. Click "Add" button
  6. Choose the unicode driver
  7. Click "Finish" button
  8. "MySQL Connector/ODBC Data Source Configuration" window opens
  9. Enter "Data Source Name", "TCP/IP Server", "Port", "User", "Password", "Database"
  10. Click "Test" button
  11. Get "Connection Successful" message
  12. On "Test Result" window, click "OK" button
  13. On "MySQL Connector/ODBC Data Source Configuration" window, click "OK" button
  14. See new entry "User Data Sources" list
  15. On "ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)" window, click "OK" button to close window
Alternatives:
  16a. Test not successful 
    16a1. Go to step 4 and choose "User DSN" tab instead
    
    
Connect with System or User DSN
Note: 
  -A User DSN can only be seen by you and is only accessible on this computer
  -A System DSN can be use by all users of the computer and is only accessible on the computer
  -Each table created is refreshable using right click
  -Each table created creates a query object in the "Queries & Connections" right sidebar that can be used to fill other tables ower power queries
  -Whether usign drag and drop or a query, Power Query is being used. So, the source connection at the start will always be (swap out DSN_NAME with real name): 
    Odbc.DataSource("dsn=DSN_NAME", [HierarchicalNavigation=true])
  -SQL in "SQL statement" can have only one semi-colon in it. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Open Excel file
  2. "Data" menu
  3. In the "Get & Transform Data" section, from the "Get Data" drop down choose "From Other Sources" > "From ODBC"
  4. "From ODBC" window opens
  5. Choose your MySQL DSN from the "Data source name (DSN)" drop down
  6. Click "OK" button
  7. "Navigator" window opens
  8. Choose data and click "Load" button
  9. Data appears in table in new Excel sheet
Alternatives:
  6a. Write SQL queries instead of using drag & drop
    6a1. Expand "Advanced options" section, and specify "SQL statement"
    6a2. Click "OK" button
    6a3. "ODBC" window opens
    6a4. Confirm data is as expected in the "ODBC" window
    6a5. Click "Load" button. 
    6a6. Go to step 9.
