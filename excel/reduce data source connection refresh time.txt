reconditions:
  - Different connections in the same file need to have different names
  - Each connection's data is unique
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Use more than one connection in the Excel file
  2. Only refresh a connection when an update is needed
  3. If data can be prepped with transformations, have data source do that before pulling the data
