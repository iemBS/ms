Get Packet Loss
Preconditions: 
  - Choose an IP or URL to ping
      using google.com here
  - Choose # of times to ping 
  - Choose packet size (in bytes) to ping with 
      default is 32 and max is 65,527
  - Only tests packet loss for ICMP protocol or all traffic.
  - "tracert" cmd traces route to google.com and presents each hop as an IP address.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Run "ping -n 20 google.com" in command prompt
  2. line is shown for each ping
  3. Results show packets sent, received, lost, and % lost
       example result: 
         Ping statistics for 216.58.193.78:
             Packets: Sent = 20, Received = 20, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
         Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
             Minimum = 8ms, Maximum = 15ms, Average = 9ms
  4. Try again with a greater number of pings    
Alternatives:
  3a: Packet loss occurred
