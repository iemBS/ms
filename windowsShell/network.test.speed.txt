Test Network Speed
Preconditions: 
  - Choose a website you use frequently
  - Assume google.com is a site you use frequently
Main Success Scenario:
  1."Test Network Speed to your router" use caes
  2."Test Network Speed to a favorite site" use case
  3. Do "Test Network Speed to a favorite site" use case from coffee shops and work
  4. Compare the results of the two use cases to see what makes sense
       - different positions from and around your router can give different results
       - [xxx: need to fill in]
  5. Use "tracert" command, from each place you use internet, to see the slow spots on the way to your frequented site. 
  
  
Test Network Speed to your Router
Preconditions: 
  - Know the network adapter you are connected to the network with. We are currently assuming "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi"
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Open windows shell
  2. Execute "ipconfig" cmd
  3. Get IP from "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" > "Default Gateway"
  4. Do tests like found in "Test Network Speed to a favorite site" use case
  

Test Network Speed to a favorite site
Note: 
  - Max packet size is 65,535 bytes
  - ping cmd spec does not note a max number of pings (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-42)
  - Systems do have thresholds where they assume a no reply. 
    - Windows is 4 seconds
  - A busy server may have a larger ping response time. A ping response is lower priority for the server.
  - If a person in the US pings (with 32 byte packet size) a server in the US, any time greater than 50 ms is a slow response. 
Preconditions: 
  - Choose a website you use frequently
  - Assume google.com is a website you use frequently
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Open windows shell.
  2. Execute "ping google.com" cmd
  3. See cmd results

  5. Execute "ping -l 64 google.com" cmd to check w larger packet sizes
  6. See cmd results
  7. Execute "ping -n 8 google.com" cmd to check w larger number of requests
