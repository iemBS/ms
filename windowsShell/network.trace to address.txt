Trace to Address
Preconditions: 
  - Choose URL or IP to trace to
      choosing "google.com" here
  - Hop 1 is client gateway
  - Hop 2 is ISP gateway
  - 3 packets are sent round trip for each hop
  - Times/latencies (in ms) for the 3 trips are called RTT1, RTT2, & RTT3
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Run "tracert -d google.com"
  2. Wait for trace to complete
  3. Result has time and IP for each hop. 
  4. Compare RTTs to see hop RTT time/latency consistency. 
Alternatives:
  3a. lines with "Request timed out" and * 
    3a1. Packet is lost or device configured to not respond. 
    3a2. Try same from other computers on the network. 
    
    
    
    
 Notes
  - If packet loss occurs, it is typically with hop 2. 
    - This indicates there may be an issue with 
        - the ISP gateway
        - link(s) between the Client gateway and ISP gateway
