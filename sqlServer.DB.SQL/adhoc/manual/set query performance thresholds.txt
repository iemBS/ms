Set Query Performance Thresholds
Notes:
  -CPU usage, Disk IO amount, & query run time have thresholds set on them
  -Disk IO measured regardless if rotating disk or solid state drive
Preconditions:
  -Exceptions to thresholds given to specific instances of these attributes: server query run from and account running query
Main Success Scenario:
  1. If Disk IO > xxx for xxx seconds, then kill query
  2. If CPU usage > xxx for xxx seconds, then kill query
  3. If query running longer than xxx seconds, then kill query
  4. Notify query runner via email that query was killed
