Note
  - Guidance from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys-sysprocesses-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017
Preconditions: 
  - "spid" column can be used to uniquly identify connections with other DB users 
  - "blocked" column indicates Session (spid) blocking your session, null (not blocked), see doc for other values (-2,-3,-4)
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Run below query
        SELECT 
            DB_NAME(dbid) as DBName, 
            COUNT(dbid) as NumberOfConnections,
            loginame as LoginName
        FROM
            sys.sysprocesses
        WHERE 
            dbid > 0
        GROUP BY 
            dbid, loginame
  2. See connection counts for all DBs on server and logins used
Alternatives:
  1a. Only care about DB_X
    1a.Add this file to where clause
         DB_NAME(dbid) = 'DB_X'
  1b. See the status of each connection
    1b1. Add "status" column to select statement. 
  1c. See name of machine hosting SQL server
    1c1. Add "hostname" column to select statement
  1d. See command currently being executed in connection
    1d1. Add "cmd" column to select statement
  1e. See Session ID of each threads
    1e1. Add "spid" column to select statement
  1f. See Session (spid) that is blocking your Session. 
    1f1. Add "blocked" column to select statement
