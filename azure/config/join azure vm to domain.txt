Join Azure VM to a domain
-----------------------------
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-new-forest-virtual-machine/

- Create a new virtual network in Azure
	- Make sure it is in the correct region.
	- Name it "110 Azure Network"
	- Note
		- If you have a VM in Azure but not in a virtual network you cannot just move it. It needs to be deleted and recreated in the virtual network.
	
- Create an Azure Hosted Domain Controller (DC)
	- Create a VM
		- Create an A2 (2 cores & 3 GB ram) VM
		- Add VM to Virtual Network
	- Install Active Directory and make the VM a DNS Server
		- Steps to config
			> Log into VM 
			> Server Manager 
			> Dashboard 
			> Manage menu 
			> "Add Roles and Features" on Manage menu
			> "Server Roles" on "Add Roles and Features Wizard" window
			> check "Active Directory"
			> "Add Features" button
			> check "DNS Server"
			> click "Continue" button and you can configure a static ip for a dns server in your virtual network later
			> click triangle at the top of the dashboard
			> choose "Promote the server to a domain controller" on the menu that appears
			> On the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard window
				> choose "Add new forest"
				> set "Root domain name" to "dev.110Consulting.com"
				> "Next" button
				> [other configs]
				> Will see DNS Options error window since we already installed the DNS server on the VM. Can skip that error message.
			> you eventually be asked to sign out
		- You will not be able to log into the VM after it reboots. 
		- Any local accounts on that VM will have been converted to domain accounts and be listed in AD Users and Computers
		- downgrade the VM to the A0 level (shared core, 0.9 GB RAM) to save money
			- VM can be upgraded again if more config is needed
- Create a VM and associate it to the domain
