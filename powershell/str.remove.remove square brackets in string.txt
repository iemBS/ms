Remove Square Brackets in a String
Notes:
  -Guidance @ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28705134/powershell-replace-square-brackets
  -If string put in variable instead of just used in replace function, square brackets still need to be escaped
  -Square brackets only need to be escaped on the left side of the replace function. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. 
    $tstStr = "[cheese]"
    $tstStr -replace "[[\]]",""
Alternatives:
  1a. Do not excape the closed bracket
    1a1. 
      $tstStr = "[cheese]"
      $tstStr -replace "[][]",""
