Use Query Execution Plan
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. "Enable Estimated Execution Plan Display" use case
  2. "Enable Actual Execution Plan Display" use case
  
  
Enable Estimated Execution Plan Display
Note: 
  - SHOWPLAN_TEXT - Displays a basic text based estimated execution plan, without executing the query
  - SHOWPLAN_ALL - Displays a text based estimated execution plan with cost estimations, without executing the query
  - SHOWPLAN_XML - Displays an XML based estimated execution plan with cost estimations, without executing the query
  - "Display Estimated Execution Plan" button is the same as the "SHOWPLAN_XML" query option
  - guidance from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/display-the-estimated-execution-plan?view=sql-server-2017
Preconditions: 
  - Using SSMS
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Query you want the estimated execution plan for is in a query window
  2. While query window is open, click "Display Estimated Execution Plan" icon on control bar in SSMS
  3. Estimated Query Execution plan displays
Alternatives:
  1a. Enable estimated execution plan display using a SQL query
    1a1. Run this query in its own batch before running the query you want the est execution plan for
      SET SHOWPLAN_TEXT ON
      SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON
      SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON
  2a. Can't run query directly and can't capture a profiler trace
    2a1. "Get Plan from query plan cache" use case
  3a. Query contains encrypted procedure
    3a1. Cannot get est execution plan of an encrypted procedure
 
 
Get Plan from query plan cache
Note:
  - This could be handy for prod environment
Preconditions: 
  - Data Management Views (DMVs) are used to query the query plan cache
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Query the query plan cache using DMVs (example query below)
        SELECT UseCounts, Cacheobjtype, Objtype, TEXT, query_plan
        FROM sys.dm_exec_cached_plans 
        CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(plan_handle)
        CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_query_plan(plan_handle)
      
      
Enable Actual Execution Plan Display
Note: 
  - "Include Actual Execution Plan" button is the same as the "SET STATISTICS XML" query option
  - "Display Estimated Execution Plan" button is the same as the "SHOWPLAN_XML" query option
  - STATISTICS PROFILE - Executes the query and displays a text based actual execution plan
  - STATISTICS XML - Executes the query and displays an XML based actual execution plan.
Preconditions: 
  - Using SSMS
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Click "Include Actual Execution Plan" icon on control bar in SSMS
  2. Run the query you want the execution plan for
  3. Actual Query Execution plan displays
Alternatives:
  1a. Enable actual execution plan display using a SQL query
    1a1. Run this query in its own batch before running the query you want the actual execution plan for
      SET STATISTICS PROFILE ON
      SET STATISTICS XML ON
  2a. Cannot run query directly
    2a1. "Use Query Profiler" use case
  2b. Query runs to fast
    2b1. "Use Query Profiler" use case
  3a. Query contains encrypted procedure
    3a1. Cannot get actual execution plan of an encrypted procedure
    
    
Use Query Profiler
Note: 
  - Plan you get from this equal to clicking the "Include Actual Execution Plan" button
Preconditions:
  - Need an actual query plan
Main Success Scenario:
  1. In SSMS, open SQL Server Profiler tool and create a new trace
  2. On "Events Selection" tab, check "Show all events"
  3. On "Events Selection" tab, check "Performance" > "Showplan XML"
  4. Start Trace
  5. Run query
  6. Wait for query to complete
  7. Stop trace
  8. Save trace (extract event data) to an XML file
Alternatives:
  8a. Query contains encrypted procedure
    8a1. Cannot get actual execution plan of an encrypted procedure
