Main Success Scenario:
  1. "create view" must be on first line
Alternatives:
  1a. Must run some code before the view is created and need to do it in the same SQL script and a "GO" cannot be used
    1a1. Have the view creation be done with the exec() or execute() method after the code that needs to precede it
  1b. Must run some code before the view is created and need to do it in the same SQL script and a "GO" can be used. 
    1b1. Use a "GO" before the create view statement because it seperates the SQL in the file into seperate batches.
