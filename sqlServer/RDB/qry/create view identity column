Create View Identity Column
Note:
  -Peformance concerns with doing this (xxx:fill in) on the fly each time instead of storing it in a table
Main Success Scenario:
  1.Code below
  
      CREATE VIEW [vwWithIdentityCol]
      AS

      WITH CTE AS
      (
        SELECT	DISTINCT Column_Name
        FROM	information_schema.columns
      )
      SELECT	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Column_Name) - 1 AS ID,  
          Column_Name
      FROM	CTE
      GO
Alternatives:
  1a. Use a sub query instead of a CTE
