Filter during left join
Notes:
  -Assuming left outer join instead of right, for clarity
  -Filtering the right table within the join will limit only the right table and not the whole query like would occur if you filter in the where clause
  -Similiar logic holds if you have a right join
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Specify filters for the right table within the join
Alternatives:
  1a. Specify filters for the right table in where clause
    1a1. The whole query will be limited to the filters specified for the right able.
