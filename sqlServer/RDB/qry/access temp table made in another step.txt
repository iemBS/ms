Access Temp table made in another step
Note:
  -Temp tables must be created outsie of an execute statement and then used inside the execute statement 
  -Temp table cannot be created in one execute statement and then used in another execute statement. These are two different sessions.
Main Success Scenario:
  1.See the following code 

    CREATE TABLE #db1
    (...table definition...)

    CREATE TABLE #db2
    (...table definition...)

    EXECUTE('INSERT #db1 SELECT * FROM ' + @db1)
    EXECUTE('INSERT #db2 SELECT * FROM ' + @db2)
