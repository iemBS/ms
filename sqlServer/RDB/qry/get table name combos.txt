Get Table Name Combinations
Main Success Scenario:
  1. see code below
  
DECLARE @tableName varchar(60) -- enter a table or view name with or without db or schema

SET @tableName = '[my db].[my schema].[my table name]'

/*
Enter a table name in the form of [db].[schema].[table/view] and get all permutations of that name that could be used in code back
*/

-- clean up
IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#permutation') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE #permutation

-- split a table name with the form of [db].[schema].[table/view] and split it into its db, schema, and table\view name parts
Select 
	*,
	identity(int,1,1) as id
into
	#parts
From
	string_split(@tableName,'.')

if (select count(1) from #parts) < 3
begin
	print 'A three part table name must be entered'
	return 
end

-- store db part in the db table
Select
	[value] as db
into
	#db
From
	#parts
Where
	id = 1

if (select charindex('[',db) From #db) = 0
begin
	print 'DB part of name must have square brackets'
	return
end

-- store schema part in the schema table 
Select
	[value] as [schema]
into
	#schema
From
	#parts
Where
	id = 2

if (select charindex('[',[schema]) From #schema) = 0
begin
	print 'Schema part of name must have square brackets'
	return
end

-- store table part in the table table
Select
	[value] as [table]
into
	#table
From
	#parts
Where
	id = 3

if (select charindex('[',[table]) From #table) = 0
begin
	print 'Table part of name must have square brackets'
	return
end

-- insert table name part without brackets
Insert Into
	#db
Select
	replace(replace(db,'[',''),']','')
From
	#db
Where
	CHARINDEX(CHAR(32),db,0) = 0

Insert Into
	#schema
Select
	replace(replace([schema],'[',''),']','')
From
	#schema
Where
	CHARINDEX(CHAR(32),[schema],0) = 0

Insert Into
	#table
Select
	replace(replace([table],'[',''),']','')
From
	#table
Where
	CHARINDEX(CHAR(32),[table],0) = 0

-- insert blank table name part
Insert Into
	#db
Select ''

Insert Into
	#schema
Select ''

-- any of the three parts w or wo brackets is 2 x 2 x 2 permutations
Select
	[db]+'.'+
	[schema]+'.'+
	[table] as permutation
Into
	#permutation
From
	#db
	cross join #schema
	cross join #table
Where
	[db] != ''
	And
	[schema] != ''

-- no db, schema and table w or wo brackets is 1 x 2 x 2 permutations
Insert Into	
	#permutation
Select
	[schema]+'.'+
	[table] as permutation
From
	#schema
	cross join #table
Where
	[schema] != ''

-- no db, no schema and table w or wo brackets is 1 x 1 x 2 permutations
Insert Into	
	#permutation
Select
	[table] as permutation
From
	#table

-- clean up
IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#parts') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE #parts

IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#db') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE #db

IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#schema') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE #schema

IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#table') IS NOT NULL
