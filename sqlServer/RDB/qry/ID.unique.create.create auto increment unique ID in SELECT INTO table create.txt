Create auto increment unique ID in SELECT INTO
Note:
  -Using an identity assumes teh ID needs to be unique across all the columns
  -DENSE_RANKE guidance @ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/dense-rank-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See Code Below
    select
      IDENTITY (int, 1,1) AS ID
    into
      #myTable
Alternatives:
  1a. ID needs to be based on one or more string columns in the table, but not all columns in table, and act like the unique ID of those string values. 
    1a1. See Code Below
    
      select distinct 
        myStrCol As myNiceStrColName,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY myStrCol ASC) AS myNiceIDColName 
      from
        myTbl 
      order by
        myStrCol
