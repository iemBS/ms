Find Table Usage
Notes:
  -Guidance @ https://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/tracking-table-usage-and-identifying-unused-objects
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Look @ index usage
      SELECT 
        DB_NAME(database_id) AS db_name,
          OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(object_id,database_id) AS schema_name,
          OBJECT_NAME(object_id, database_id) AS object_name,
          user_seeks + user_scans + user_lookups AS read_count,
          user_updates AS write_count,
          last_read = (
                  SELECT MAX(value)
                  FROM (
                      VALUES(last_user_seek),(last_user_scan),(last_user_lookup)
                  ) AS v(value)
              ),
           last_write = last_user_update
      FROM 
        sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats
      WHERE 
        DB_NAME(database_id) NOT IN ('master','model','tempdb','msdb')
  
  2. Look @ extended events
    SELECT 
      object_name, description
    FROM 
      sys.dm_xe_object_columns
    WHERE 
       name = 'object_id'
       
  3. Look @ table locks
      xxx:fill in
