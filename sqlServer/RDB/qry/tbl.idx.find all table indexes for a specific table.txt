Find All Table Indexes for a specific table
Main Success Scenario:
  1. see code below

select distinct 
    s.[name] as tblSchema,
    t.[name] as tblNm,
    i.[name] as idxNm
from
    sys.indexes i
    inner join sys.index_columns ic on 
    i.object_id = ic.object_id
    and
    i.index_id = ic.index_id
    inner join sys.columns c on 
    ic.object_id = c.object_id
    and
    ic.column_id = c.column_id
    inner join sys.tables t on 
    c.object_id = t.object_id
    inner join sys.schemas s on 
    t.schema_id = s.schema_id
    inner join sys.columns c2 on   
    t.object_id = c2.object_id /* not joined to sys.indexes table */
where
    t.type_desc = 'USER_TABLE' -- only look at indices on tables
    AND
    i.type_desc = 'NONCLUSTERED' -- has a non-clustered key
	and
	s.[name] = 'DA' -- filter on table schema
	and
	t.[name] = 'FASTActivity' -- filter on table name
    --and
    --t.modify_date > '2019-01-01 14:31:07.133' -- table structure created/modified recently
order by
    tblSchema,
    tblNm,
	idxNm
