Refresh View Meta Data after underlying tables are changed
Notes:
  -Guidance @ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-refreshview-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017
  -If a column is added to the underlying table and that same column is exposed in the view via an alter statement, there is no reason to run the sp_refreshview.
Preconditions:
  -Assume column in underlying table and exposed in the view is changed to cause a change in its presentation or removed. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. exec sys.sp_refreshview '[mySchema].[myTable]'
