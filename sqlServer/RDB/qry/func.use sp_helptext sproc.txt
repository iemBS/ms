Use sp_helptext sproc
Notes:
  -Have to refer to view that current session is pointing to. So, cannot use a [db].[schema].[view/sproc/func] naming convention.
  -This example takes a view as a parameter. sp_helptext can also be used on procedures and functions.  
Main Success Scenario:
  1.exec sp_helptext '[dbo].[vwMyView]'
