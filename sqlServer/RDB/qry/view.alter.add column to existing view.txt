Add Column to Existing View
Notes:
  -Guidance @ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-view-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017
  -Altering a view does not affect dependent sprocs or triggers
  -Altering a view does not change the permissions on the view
  -If ALTER VIEW is not used, but instead the view is dropped and re-created, the previously used GRANT statement and any other statements that deal with permissions pertaining to this view must be re-entered.
  -To execute ALTER VIEW, at a minimum, ALTER permission on OBJECT is required.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below

      ALTER VIEW HumanResources.EmployeeHireDate  
      AS  
      SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.HireDate  
      FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e JOIN Person.Person AS p  
      ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID  
      WHERE HireDate < CONVERT(DATETIME,'20020101',101) ;  
      GO
