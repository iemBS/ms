Use NTILE Rank Function to Create Table Divider
Note: 
  -Guidance @ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/ntile-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15
  -The ORDER BY is key to defining the how the table is cut up
  -Finding the columns to use in the ORDER BY may be a pre-task to using the NTILE function
  -To find the columns to contribute to the ORDER BY get the distinct value count of all the columns in the table to see what columns have the highest percent of distinct values
Main Success Scenario:
  1.See code below
  
      USE AdventureWorks2012;  
      GO  
      SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName  
          ,NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY a.PostalCode) AS Quartile  
          ,s.SalesYTD  
          ,a.PostalCode  
      FROM Sales.SalesPerson AS s   
          INNER JOIN Person.Person AS p   
              ON s.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID  
          INNER JOIN Person.Address AS a   
              ON a.AddressID = p.BusinessEntityID  
      WHERE TerritoryID IS NOT NULL AND SalesYTD <> 0;
