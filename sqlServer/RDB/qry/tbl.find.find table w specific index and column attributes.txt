Find Tables with specific index and column attributes
Main Success Scenario:
  1. see code below
  
     select top 100
      tblSchema,
      tblNm,
      idxNm
    from
      (
        select distinct 
          s.[name] as tblSchema,
          t.[name] as tblNm,
          i.[name] as idxNm
        from
          sys.indexes i
          inner join sys.index_columns ic on 
            i.object_id = ic.object_id
            and
            i.index_id = ic.index_id
          inner join sys.columns c on 
            ic.object_id = c.object_id
            and
            ic.column_id = c.column_id
          inner join sys.tables t on 
            c.object_id = t.object_id
          inner join sys.schemas s on 
            t.schema_id = s.schema_id
          inner join sys.columns c2 on   
            t.object_id = c2.object_id /* not joined to sys.indexes table */
        where
          t.type_desc = 'USER_TABLE' -- only look at indices on tables
          AND
          i.type_desc = 'NONCLUSTERED' -- has a non-clustered key
          and
          c.[name] = '[column in the index]' -- filter on column in the index
          and
          c2.[name] = '[just column in the table]' -- filter ona column that is in the table and does not have to be in the index
          and
          t.modify_date > '2019-01-01 14:31:07.133' -- table structure created/modified recently
      ) t
    order by
      tblSchema,
      tblNm,
      idxNm
