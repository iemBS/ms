Use Variables in SQL script run by SQLCmd
Notes:
 - Guidance from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/scripting/sqlcmd-use-with-scripting-variables?view=sql-server-2017
 - Just like SQL run in SSMS, variables are cleared after a "GO" is run. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Run following on a command line
      sqlcmd
      :setvar  MYDATABASE AdventureWorks2012
      USE $(MYDATABASE);
      GO
Alternatives:
  1a. value has spaces 
    1a1. Use double quotes on value
      :setvar  MYDATABASE "AdventureWorks 2012"
