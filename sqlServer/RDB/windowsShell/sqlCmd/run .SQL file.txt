Run .SQL file with SqlCmd command
Notes:
  -Guidance from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/scripting/sqlcmd-run-transact-sql-script-files?view=sql-server-2017
  -Path to "sqlcmd.exe" does not need to be noted as long as environment variables are set to find it on your system on-the-fly.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Run the following command in a command window where
       [server name] = server name
       [file path] = Path to file. if myScript.sql is at C:\folder1\myScript.sql, this would be “C:\folder1”

     sqlcmd –S[server name] –i [file path]\myScript.sql
Alternatives:
  1a. Need to note parameter that is used in the myScript.sql file
    1a1. SET myVar = varValue
         sqlcmd –S[server name] –i [file path]\myScript.sql
  1b. Need to output results to a text file
    1b1. sqlcmd –S[server name] –i [file path]\myScript.sql -o [file path]\myOutput.txt
