  -Guidance @ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-flat-file-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard?view=sql-server-ver15
  -Header Rows to Skip attribute: Specify the number of rows to skip at the top of the file
  -Columns Name in the First DAta Row attribute: Specify whether the first row (after any skipped rows) contains column names.
  -Noting a text qualifier for a column does not mean that all values in a column need to be surrounded by that text qualifier. Only the values that are seen as text by SQL server need to be surrounded by the text qualifier.
