Choose Olap Storage Mode
Note:
  - Guidance from https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/19898.differences-between-olap-rolap-molap-and-holap.aspx
  - MOLAP is Multidimensional Online Analytical Processing
  - ROLAP is Relational Online Analytical Processing
  - HOLAP is Hybrid Online Analytical Processing
  - For ROLAP, aggregations of partitions stored in indexed views in the relational DB (partition's data source) and not SSAS
  - For MOLAP, copy of source data stored in multi dim structure in SSAS
  - For ROLAP & HOLAP, detail/atomic data stored in indexed views in the relational DB (partition's data source) and not SSAS
  - For MOLAP & HOLAP, aggregations for partition are stored in SSAS and not indexed views in relational DB (partition's data source)
Preconditions:
  - detail/atomic level data will not be accessed often
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Queries for aggregations need to be fast (use MOLAP or HOLAP)
  2. Queries for detail/atomic level data in cube do NOT need to be fast (use HOLAP to meat step 1 & 2 conditions)
  3. Few queries are run against the cube
  4. Cube is large (use ROLAP or HOLAP)
  5. Cube has simple start schema
Alternatives
  1a. latest data in aggregations is more important than fast queries for aggregations
    1a1. Use ROLAP 
  2a. queries for detail/atomic level data in cube do need to be fast
    2a1. Use MOLAP
  4a. Cube is small
    4a1. Use MOLAP
Extensions:
  3a. ROLAP may make sense since common queries will try to make use of query cache before pulling data from relational DB
