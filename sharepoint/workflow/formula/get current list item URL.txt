Get Current List Item URL
Notes:
  -All variables need to be entered in via the UI and not pasted
  -Some of the variables are the fields from a list item
  -A variable for the current item in the list will be surrounded by square brackets and percents, like the ID field in [%Current Item:ID%]
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Get the URL for display perspective of a list item
  2. Find the "ID" variable in the URL
  3. Swap out the ID variable value with "[%Current Item:ID%]"
