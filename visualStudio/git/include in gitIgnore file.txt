Include in .gitignore file
Note:
  -These are from https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657
    -which was referenced @ https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files
  -Establish this before using your Git instance because the .gitignore file will not work after tracking of a file has started. 
  -If you want to ignore a file after tracking has started you have to remove the tracking on the file. 
    -Do that using a command like "git rm --cached FILENAME"
